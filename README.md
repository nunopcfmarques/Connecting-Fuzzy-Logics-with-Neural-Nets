# PIC2

## Connecting T-Norm Logics with Neural Networks

This repository contains both code and documents related to the development of the PIC2.

### Roadmap
<ul>
  <li>Develop skeleton for logics [x]</li>
  <li>Develop function to allow evaluation for syntatically correct formulas [x] </li>
  <li>From a formula develop a trained ReLU network and perform some tests [x] </li>
  <li>Allow network composition [x] </li>
  <li>From a ReLU network develop a formula [] </li>
  <li>Output formulas while the network is training to see evolution [] </li>
  <li>Perform tests using simple networks []</li>
</ul>
